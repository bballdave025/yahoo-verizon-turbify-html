For my personal website at [bballdave025.com]
For now, it only allows a small bit of HTML, 
and that's not even in full-HTML format. I
don't have to define a `head` nor a `body`,
and there's no `html` tag surrounding stuff.
There's none of the specifications at the 
beginning, either.

I have to copy/paste from the online editor,
but it's nice to be able to roll back. I
definitely used it!
